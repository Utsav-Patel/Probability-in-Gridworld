# Probability-in-Gridworld
This is the third project of the course Introduction of Artificial Intelligence at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, New Brunswick

We used python version 3.8.12 and conda version 4.8.3 for this project.

For this project we had to create a random grid world and also randomize the position of the goal on that grid world. Each space on the grid world had a terrain type which dictated
the probability that it contained the target. Each space also had a chance of giving us a false negative result when we checked if it contained the goal cell. 

The first agent we created would check the grid world for the cell that had the highest probability of containing the target and examined that cell. The second agent would check
the grid world for the cell that had the highest probability of containing the target and examined that cell. The third agent was an agent we created by tweaking the
formula used by the first two agents. And the final agent we had to create was an agent of our own choice that outperformed all three other agents.

An indepth explanation of the formulae used for all agents and the description of the terrain types etc is given in [our report here](https://github.com/Utsav-Patel/Probability-in-Gridworld/blob/master/Probability_in_Gridworld.pdf)

##### Agents 6, 7 and 8 comparison when target is in flat terrain

First we compare the performance of the agents when the target is in flat terrain. We define total actions as number of movements plus number of examinations. Here we want to
see as low of a number as possible since total actions correlates with time taken for running -

</p>

As we can see Agent eight (which is agent three for this project) performs the best overall and takes the least number of actions on average.


##### Agents 6, 7 and 8 comparison when target is in forest terrain

Next we compare the performance of the agents when the target is in forest terrain.

</p>

As we can see Agent eight again performs the best overall and takes the least number of actions on average.


##### Agents 6, 7 and 8 comparison when target is in hilly terrain

Next we compare the performance of the agents when the target is in hilly terrain.

<p align="center">
	<img src="/images/hilly_target_80_grids_100x100_total_actions_comparison_histogram.png">
</p>

As we can see Agent eight again performs the best overall and takes the least number of actions on average.

Thus Agent eight performs the best overall as expected. 


##### Agents 9 data for average number of actions for any terrain

Here we wanted to show the performance of our own agent, Agent nine as a table of average values -

As we can see Agent nine massively outperforms our other agents.
